## Performance Anti-Patterns

### 1. No Partitioning Strategy

**Problem**: Full table scans without partition pruning
**Impact**: High I/O costs, slow execution

**Anti-Pattern Example**:
```sql
-- BAD: No partition filtering
SELECT * FROM large_dataset WHERE amount > 1000
```

**Best Practice**:
```sql
-- GOOD: Use partition columns in WHERE clause
SELECT * FROM large_dataset 
WHERE amount > 1000 AND date = '2024-01-01'
```

### 2. Inefficient Join Strategy

**Problem**: Multiple large table joins without optimization
**Impact**: High shuffle costs, memory pressure

**Anti-Pattern Example**:
```sql
-- BAD: Large table joins without hints
SELECT * FROM large_table1 l1
JOIN large_table2 l2 ON l1.id = l2.id
JOIN large_table3 l3 ON l2.id = l3.id
```

**Best Practice**:
```sql
-- GOOD: Use broadcast joins for small tables
SELECT /*+ BROADCAST(small_table) */ *
FROM large_table l
JOIN small_table s ON l.id = s.id
```

### 3. No Caching Strategy

**Problem**: Repeated expensive computations
**Impact**: Redundant CPU cycles, wasted resources

**Anti-Pattern Example**:
```sql
-- BAD: Repeated aggregations
WITH expensive_calc AS (
    SELECT department, AVG(salary) as avg_salary
    FROM employees GROUP BY department
)
SELECT * FROM expensive_calc; -- Computed multiple times
```

**Best Practice**:
```sql
-- GOOD: Cache intermediate results
CACHE TABLE dept_avg_salary AS
SELECT department, AVG(salary) as avg_salary
FROM employees GROUP BY department;
```

### 4. Inefficient Aggregation Strategy

**Problem**: Multiple window functions with different partitions
**Impact**: High memory usage, poor scalability

**Anti-Pattern Example**:
```sql
-- BAD: Multiple window functions
SELECT *,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY dept1 ORDER BY salary),
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY dept2 ORDER BY salary),
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY dept3 ORDER BY salary)
FROM employees
```

**Best Practice**:
```sql
-- GOOD: Optimize window functions
SELECT *,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY department ORDER BY salary)
FROM employees
```

### 5. Memory Inefficient Operations

**Problem**: Expensive string operations and complex calculations
**Impact**: High memory usage, garbage collection pressure

**Anti-Pattern Example**:
```sql
-- BAD: Complex string operations
SELECT CONCAT(name, ' - ', department, ' - ', CAST(salary AS STRING))
FROM employees
```

**Best Practice**:
```sql
-- GOOD: Minimize string operations
SELECT name, department, salary
FROM employees
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Partitioning Strategy

- **Use partition columns in WHERE clauses**
- **Choose appropriate partition sizes**
- **Avoid partition skew**

### 2. Join Optimization

- **Use broadcast joins for small tables (< 10MB)**
- **Optimize join order**
- **Use appropriate join types**

### 3. Caching Strategy

- **Cache frequently used DataFrames**
- **Use appropriate storage levels**
- **Monitor cache usage**

### 4. Aggregation Optimization

- **Use efficient window functions**
- **Optimize GROUP BY operations**
- **Use appropriate aggregation functions**

### 5. Memory Management

- **Minimize object creation**
- **Use efficient data types**
- **Monitor memory usage**

## Configuration Optimization

### Spark Configuration

```python
SPARK_CONFIG = {
    # Adaptive Query Execution
    "spark.sql.adaptive.enabled": "true",
    "spark.sql.adaptive.coalescePartitions.enabled": "true",
    
    # Broadcast joins
    "spark.sql.autoBroadcastJoinThreshold": "10m",
    
    # Shuffle optimization
    "spark.sql.shuffle.partitions": "200",
    
    # Memory management
    "spark.sql.adaptive.advisoryPartitionSizeInBytes": "128m"
}
```

### Application Configuration

```python
APP_CONFIG = {
    "enable_monitoring": True,
    "collect_metrics": True,
    "log_execution_plans": True
}
```

## Monitoring and Tuning

### Performance Metrics

- **Query execution time**
- **Memory usage**
- **CPU utilization**
- **Shuffle operations**
- **I/O operations**

### Monitoring Tools

- **Spark UI**
- **Spark History Server**
- **Custom metrics collection**

### Tuning Techniques

- **Analyze execution plans**
- **Monitor resource usage**
- **Optimize data distribution**
- **Adjust configuration parameters**

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue 1: Out of Memory Errors

**Symptoms**: `java.lang.OutOfMemoryError`
**Solutions**:
- Increase executor memory
- Optimize data partitioning
- Use broadcast joins
- Cache intermediate results

### Issue 2: Slow Query Execution

**Symptoms**: Long execution times
**Solutions**:
- Analyze execution plans
- Optimize join strategies
- Use appropriate indexes
- Partition data effectively

### Issue 3: Data Skew

**Symptoms**: Uneven data distribution
**Solutions**:
- Use salt technique
- Optimize partition strategy
- Use adaptive query execution
- Repartition data

### Issue 4: Excessive Shuffling

**Symptoms**: High shuffle costs
**Solutions**:
- Use broadcast joins
- Optimize join order
- Reduce data movement
- Use appropriate partition sizes

## Performance Testing

### Test Scenarios

1. **Small dataset testing**
2. **Large dataset testing**
3. **Concurrent query testing**
4. **Memory pressure testing**

### Benchmarking

- **Query execution time**
- **Resource utilization**
- **Throughput measurements**
- **Scalability testing**
